  "nutrient.protein": "Protein",
  "nutrient.protein.desc": "Essential building block for muscles, organs, and immune function.",
  "nutrient.protein.body_effect": "Protein builds and repairs every tissue in your body, from muscles and bones to skin and hair. It also makes enzymes and hormones that keep your metabolism running. Children and teens need it for growth, adults for maintenance, and seniors for preventing muscle loss.",

  "nutrient.fat": "Fat",
  "nutrient.fat.desc": "Concentrated energy source that supports cell growth and nutrient absorption.",
  "nutrient.fat.body_effect": "Fat cushions your organs, insulates your body, and helps absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K. Your brain is nearly 60% fat. Infants and toddlers need the most fat relative to body size because their brains are developing rapidly. Choose unsaturated fats from fish, nuts, and olive oil over saturated sources.",

  "nutrient.carbs": "Carbohydrates",
  "nutrient.carbs.desc": "Your body's preferred and most efficient source of energy.",
  "nutrient.carbs.body_effect": "Carbohydrates break down into glucose, which fuels your brain, muscles, and central nervous system. Complex carbs from whole grains, legumes, and vegetables release energy slowly and steadily. All age groups need carbs, but active teens and athletes need the most. Choose whole grains over refined ones for lasting energy and better blood sugar control.",

  "nutrient.fiber": "Fiber",
  "nutrient.fiber.desc": "Supports healthy digestion, feeds beneficial gut bacteria, and helps control blood sugar.",
  "nutrient.fiber.body_effect": "Fiber keeps your digestive system moving smoothly, feeds the good bacteria in your gut, and helps you feel full longer after meals. It also slows sugar absorption, which steadies blood sugar levels. Adults and seniors benefit most from high fiber intake for heart health and regularity, but children need it too for healthy digestion.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_a": "Vitamin A",
  "nutrient.vitamin_a.desc": "Supports vision, immune function, and healthy skin.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_a.body_effect": "Vitamin A is critical for sharp vision, especially in low light. It also keeps your skin and the linings of your lungs and gut healthy, acting as a first line of defense against infections. Children need vitamin A for proper growth and immune development. Found abundantly in orange and dark green vegetables.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_b12": "Vitamin B12",
  "nutrient.vitamin_b12.desc": "Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_b12.body_effect": "Vitamin B12 keeps your nerves working properly and helps make red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body. A deficiency can cause fatigue, weakness, and nerve problems. Seniors are at highest risk because absorption decreases with age. Vegans and vegetarians should pay special attention, as B12 is found almost exclusively in animal foods.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_c": "Vitamin C",
  "nutrient.vitamin_c.desc": "Powerful antioxidant that boosts immunity and helps the body absorb iron.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_c.body_effect": "Vitamin C protects your cells from damage, helps wounds heal faster, and boosts your immune system's ability to fight infections. It also dramatically improves iron absorption when eaten alongside iron-rich foods. Important for all ages, but especially for growing children and anyone recovering from illness or injury.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_d": "Vitamin D",
  "nutrient.vitamin_d.desc": "The sunshine vitamin that strengthens bones and supports immune health.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_d.body_effect": "Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, making it essential for strong bones and teeth. It also plays a major role in immune function and mood regulation. Your skin produces it from sunlight, but many people do not get enough, especially in northern climates. Seniors need more because their skin becomes less efficient at making it, and infants need it because breast milk provides very little.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_e": "Vitamin E",
  "nutrient.vitamin_e.desc": "Antioxidant that protects cells from damage and supports skin health.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_e.body_effect": "Vitamin E acts as a shield for your cells, protecting them from oxidative damage caused by pollution, UV rays, and normal metabolism. It supports healthy skin, helps your immune system fight off bacteria and viruses, and may slow age-related decline. All ages benefit, but it is particularly relevant for adults and seniors as a protective nutrient.",

  "nutrient.vitamin_k": "Vitamin K",
  "nutrient.vitamin_k.desc": "Essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.",
  "nutrient.vitamin_k.body_effect": "Vitamin K is the reason a cut stops bleeding. Without enough of it, even a small wound could be dangerous. It also directs calcium into your bones rather than your arteries, which matters for long-term heart and bone health. Adults and seniors need the most. Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach are the richest sources by far.",

  "nutrient.calcium": "Calcium",
  "nutrient.calcium.desc": "The most abundant mineral in your body, critical for bones and teeth.",
  "nutrient.calcium.body_effect": "About 99% of your calcium lives in your bones and teeth, giving them their strength and structure. The remaining 1% is vital for muscle contractions, nerve signaling, and heart rhythm. Teens need the most because they are building peak bone mass. Seniors need plenty to slow bone loss. Dairy, sardines with bones, and calcium-set tofu are top sources.",

  "nutrient.iron": "Iron",
  "nutrient.iron.desc": "Carries oxygen in your blood and supports energy production.",
  "nutrient.iron.body_effect": "Iron is the core of hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to every part of your body. Without enough iron, you feel tired, weak, and unable to concentrate. Teens, especially girls after menstruation begins, and young women need the most. Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C to boost absorption significantly.",

  "nutrient.magnesium": "Magnesium",
  "nutrient.magnesium.desc": "Involved in over 300 enzyme reactions, from energy production to muscle relaxation.",
  "nutrient.magnesium.body_effect": "Magnesium is a behind-the-scenes powerhouse involved in over 300 biochemical reactions. It helps your muscles relax after contracting, keeps your heart rhythm steady, supports strong bones, and regulates blood sugar. Deficiency is surprisingly common and can cause muscle cramps, poor sleep, and anxiety. Adults and seniors benefit most from increasing intake through nuts, seeds, and dark leafy greens.",

  "nutrient.potassium": "Potassium",
  "nutrient.potassium.desc": "Regulates fluid balance, muscle contractions, and blood pressure.",
  "nutrient.potassium.body_effect": "Potassium works alongside sodium to control fluid balance in your cells and regulate blood pressure. It helps muscles contract properly, including your heart muscle. Most people do not eat enough potassium, which can raise blood pressure over time. Adults and seniors benefit the most from increasing intake. Bananas are famous for potassium, but sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados actually contain more.",

  "nutrient.zinc": "Zinc",
  "nutrient.zinc.desc": "Supports immune defense, wound healing, and taste perception.",
  "nutrient.zinc.body_effect": "Zinc is essential for a strong immune system, helping your body fight off viruses and bacteria. It also speeds wound healing, supports your sense of taste and smell, and plays a role in cell division. Teens need more during growth spurts, and seniors often absorb less efficiently. Beef, shellfish, and legumes are excellent sources.",

  "nutrient.selenium": "Selenium",
  "nutrient.selenium.desc": "Trace mineral that supports thyroid function and protects against oxidative damage.",
  "nutrient.selenium.body_effect": "Selenium works quietly but powerfully. It helps your thyroid produce hormones that regulate metabolism, protects your cells from oxidative damage, and supports your immune system. Only a small amount is needed, but deficiency can impair thyroid function and immune response. Brazil nuts are so rich in selenium that just one or two per day covers your needs. All age groups benefit equally.",

  "nutrient.omega_3": "Omega-3 Fatty Acids",
  "nutrient.omega_3.desc": "Essential fats that support brain, heart, and joint health.",
  "nutrient.omega_3.body_effect": "Omega-3s are fats your body cannot make on its own, so you must get them from food. They reduce inflammation, support brain function and memory, protect your heart, and may ease joint stiffness. Children need them for brain development, adults for heart protection, and seniors for both cognitive health and reducing inflammation. Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are the best sources of the most active forms (EPA and DHA).",

  "nutrient.folate": "Folate",
  "nutrient.folate.desc": "B vitamin critical for cell division, DNA synthesis, and preventing birth defects.",
  "nutrient.folate.body_effect": "Folate is essential every time your body makes new cells, which happens constantly. It is critical during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in developing babies, making it the most important nutrient for women of childbearing age. It also supports red blood cell production and helps prevent anemia. Lentils, spinach, and black beans are excellent plant-based sources.",
